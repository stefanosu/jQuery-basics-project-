# jQuery-basics-project-

Created a project using basic jQuery event handlers 

I was using jQuery event handler in order to enable the jpg to move although unfortunately couldn't be able to get it to work on my browser I suspect it has something to do with my jQuery. I will get it working soon.


How to run the Project: Clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/stefanosu/jQuery-basics-project-

Open index.html in your browser.
